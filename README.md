### Setup

One you have cloned the repository cd into the folder and run bundle install, this will install the necessary gems.


#### Step 1
This project relies on * [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to manage environment variables, dotenv user a file ".env" in the root directory of the app to declare environment variables. For obvious reasons I have not included my .env file in the repository so you will have to create on yourself with your own information.
